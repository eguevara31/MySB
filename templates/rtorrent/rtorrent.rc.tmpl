######################################################################

#### GENERAL SETTINGS

## Bind listening socket and outgoing connections to this network interface address.
network.bind_address.set = <server_ip>

## Set the address reported to the tracker.
network.local_address.set = <server_ip>

## Try to open a listening port in the range a up to and including b.
network.port_range.set = <port_range>

## Open the listening port at a random position in the port range.
network.port_random.set = no

## Perform hash check on torrents that have finished downloading.
## Check hash for finished torrents. Might be useful until the bug is fixed that causes lack of diskspace not to be properly reported.
pieces.hash.on_completion.set = no

## Set the default download directory. Defaults to "./".
directory.default.set = ~/rtorrent/complete

## Session management will be enabled and the torrent files for all open downloads will be stored in this directory.
## Only one instance of rtorrent should be used with each session directory, though at the moment no locking is done.
## An empty string will disable the session directory.
session.path.set = ~/rtorrent/.session

## Use a http proxy. Use an empty string to disable.
network.http.proxy_address.set =

## Add a preferred filename encoding to the list.
## The encodings are attempted in the order they are inserted, if none match the torrent default is used.
encoding.add = utf8

## Set how rtorrent should deal with encrypted Bittorrent connections.
## By default, encryption is disabled, equivalent to specifying the option none.
## Alternatively, any number of the following options may be specified:
##		allow_incoming (allow incoming encrypted connections),
##		try_outgoing (use encryption for outgoing connections),
##		require (disable unencrypted handshakes),
##		require_RC4 (also disable plaintext transmission after the initial encrypted handshake),
##		enable_retry (if the initial outgoing connection fails, retry with encryption turned on if it was off or off if it was on),
##		prefer_plaintext (choose plaintext when peer offers a choice between plaintext transmission and RC4 encryption, otherwise RC4 will be used).
# Enforce encryption
protocol.encryption.set = require, require_RC4, allow_incoming, try_outgoing, enable_retry, prefer_plaintext
# Allow encryption
#protocol.encryption.set = allow_incoming, try_outgoing, enable_retry, prefer_plaintext

## Call command every interval seconds, starting from start.
## An interval of zero calls the task once, while a start of zero calls it immediately.
## Currently command is forwarded to the option handler.
## Start and interval may optionally use a time format, dd:hh:mm:ss.
## F.ex to start a task every day at 18:00, use 18:00:00,24:00:00.
## schedule2 = id,start,interval,command
## commands: stop_untied =, close_untied =, remove_untied =
## stop, close or remove the torrents that are tied to filenames that have been deleted.
#
## watch a directory for new torrents, and stop those that have been deleted
schedule2 = watch_directory,5,5,"load.start=~/rtorrent/watch/*.torrent,d.custom2.set=~/rtorrent/torrents/"

# schedule2 = tied_directory,5,5,start_tied=
# schedule2 = untied_directory,5,5,close_untied=
#
# close torrents when diskspace is low. */
schedule2 = low_diskspace,5,60,close_low_diskspace=10240M
#
# Periodically save session data
schedule2 = session_save,240,300,session_save=~/rtorrent/.session
#
## stop torrents when reaching upload ratio in percent,
## when also reaching total upload in bytes, or when
## reaching final upload ratio in percent
## example: stop at ratio 2.0 with at least 200 MB uploaded, or else ratio 20.0
#schedule2 = ratio,60,60,stop_on_ratio=200,200M,2000
#
## alternative calls to bind and IP that should handle dynamic IP's
#schedule2 = ip_tick,0,1800,ip=rakshasa
#schedule2 = bind_tick,0,1800,bind=rakshasa
#
## example of scheduling commands: Switch between two ip's every 5 seconds
#schedule2 = "ip_tick1,5,10,ip=torretta"
#schedule2 = "ip_tick2,10,10,ip=lampedusa"
#
## Delete id from the scheduler.
#
#schedule_remove2 = "ip_tick1"

## Start torrents that are tied to filenames that have been re-added.
#
#start_tied =

## Stop, close or remove the torrents that are tied to filenames that have been deleted. Clear the association with the 'U' key.
#
#stop_untied =
#close_untied =
#remove_untied =

## Load and possibly start a file, or possibly multiple files by using the wild-card "*".
## This is meant for use with schedule, though ensure that the start is non-zero.
## The loaded file will be tied to the filename provided.
#
#load.normal = file
#load_verbose = file
#load.start = file
#load.start_verbose = file

## Load a resource file.
## Try_import does not throw torrent::input_error exception on bad input.
#
#import = file
#try_import = file

## Stop torrents when they reach the given upload ratio min_ratio in percent.
## If the optional min_upload is given, require a total upload amount of this many bytes as well.
## If the optional max_ratio is given, stop the torrent when reaching this ratio regardless of the total upload amount.
## Exclude certain torrent by pressing Shift+I in the downlist list.
## Use with the schedule option.
#
#stop_on_ratio = min_ratio
#min_upload, stop_on_ratio = min_ratio,min_upload,max_ratio

## Call a command on a download when its state changes.
## Only a subset of commands are available.
#
#on_insert = id,command
#on_erase = id,command
#on_open = id,command
#on_close = id,command
#on_start = id,command
#on_stop = id,command
#on_hash_queued = id,command
#on_hash_removed = id,command
#on_hash_done = id,command
#on_finished = id,command


#### THROTTLE SETTINGS

## Set the maximum global upload and download rates.
## Global upload and download rate in KiB. "0" for unlimited
throttle.global_up.max_rate.set_kb = 0
throttle.global_down.max_rate.set_kb = 0

## Set the minimum and maximum number of peers to allow in each download.
#throttle.min_peers.normal.set = 1
#throttle.max_peers.normal.set = 50

## Set the minimum and maximum number of peers to allow while seeding, or -1 (default) to use throttle.max_peers.normal.set.
#throttle.min_peers.seed.set = -1
#throttle.max_peers.seed.set = -1

## Set the maximum number of simultaneous uploads per download.
#throttle.max_uploads.set = 10

## Change the divider used to calculate the max upload and download slots to use when the throttle is changed.
## Disable by setting 0.
#throttle.max_uploads.div.set = 1
#throttle.max_downloads.div.set = 1

## Max upload and download slots allowed.
## Disable by setting 0.
#throttle.max_uploads.global.set = 5
#throttle.max_downloads.global.set = 10

#### TRACKER RELATED SETTINGS

# Tracker related settings.

## Set to no to disable all tracker requests.
## Useful for disabling rtorrent with the schedule command.
trackers.enable=yes

## Set the numwant field sent to the tracker, which indicates how many peers we want.
## A negative value disables this feature.
#trackers.numwant.set = -1

## Use UDP trackers.
## Disable if you are behind a firewall, etc, that does not allow connections to UDP trackers.
trackers.use_udp.set = no

## Set the certificates to use in http requests.
## See Curl's CURLOPT_CAPATH and CURLOPT_CAINFO options for further information.
network.http.capath.set = /etc/ssl/certs
network.http.cacert.set = <InstallDir>/ssl/mysb.cert
network.http.ssl_verify_peer.set = 0

#### USER-INTERFACE SETTINGS

# Display related settings.

## Create a new view.
#
#view_add = name

## Sort a view according the the criteria set by view.sort_current.
## If the optional argument is supplied, the view is not sorted if a change happened during the last seconds.
## This command is meant to be used with schedule.
#
#view.sort = name
#view.sort = name,seconds

## Set the sorting criteria for when new elements inserted or view.sort is called.
## The list can contain any number of criteria, including zero, from the following:
## name, name_reverse, stopped, started, complete, incomplete, state_changed, state_changed_reverse
#view.sort_new = name
#view.sort_current = name
#...

## Set a list of filter to apply when new new downloads are added and when view_sort is called.
## All filters must match for the download to be included.
## stopped, started, complete, incomplete,
#
#view.filter = name

## Change the key-bindings.
## qwerty|azerty|qwertz|dvorak
#keys.layout.set = azerty


#### FILE-SYSTEM SETTINGS

# File-system related settings.

## Preallocate files; reduces defragmentation on filesystems.
#
system.file.allocate.set = no

## Set the maximum size a file can have.
## Disable by passing -1.
#system.file.max_size.set = -1

## Split files in a torrent larger than size into seperate files.
## Disable by passing -1.
#system.file.split_size.set = -1

## Set the suffix used on split files.
## Defaults to .part.
#system.file.split_suffix.set = .part


#### DOWNLOAD SETTINGS

# Settings that require a download as a target, the options need to be called through f.ex on_finished.

## Create or delete a symbolic link.
## The link path is the concatenation of path, the result of the type on the download, and suffix.
## Available types are; base_path uses the base path of the download, base_filename uses the base filename of the download, tied uses the path of the file the download is tied to, see start_tied.
#
#d.create_link = type,path,suffix
#d.delete_link = type,path,suffix


#### ADVANCED SETTINGS

# This list contains settings users shouldn't need to touch, some may even cause crashes or similar if incorrectly set.


## Configure how far ahead we ask the kernel to read when doing hash checking.
## The hash checker uses madvise(..., MADV_WILLNEED) for the requests.
## hash read-ahead controls how many MB to request the kernel to read ahead ahead
## if the value is too low the disk may not be fully utilized,
## while if too high the kernel might not be able to keep the read pages
## in memory thus end up trashing.
#system.hash.read_ahead.set = 8

## Interval between attempts to check the hash when the chunk is not in memory, in milliseconds.
#system.hash.interval.set = 50

## Number of attempts to check the hash while using the mincore status, before forcing.
## Overworked systems might need lower values to get a decent hash checking rate.
# number of attempts to check the hash while using the mincore status, before forcing
# overworked systems might need lower values to get a decent hash checking rate
#system.hash.max_tries.set = 3

## Always use MS_SYNC rather than MS_ASYNC when syncing chunks.
## This may be nessesary in case of filesystem bugs like NFS in linux ~2.6.13.
#
#safe_sync = yes|no

## Number of files to simultaneously keep open.
## LibTorrent dynamically opens and closes files as necessary when mapping files to memory.
## Default is based on sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX).
## You probably only think you know what this option does, so don't touch it.
#network.max_open_files.set = 192

## Number of network sockets to simultaneously keep open.
## This value is set to a reasonable value based on sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX).
#network.max_open_sockets.set = 65023

## Number of sockets to simultaneously keep open.
## This value is set to 32 by default.
#network.http.max_open.set = 32

## Adjust the send and receive buffer size for socket.
#network.send_buffer.size.set = 1M
#network.receive_buffer.size.set = 131072

## Set the umask for this process, which is applied to all files created by the program.
#system.umask.set = 0644

## Changes the working directory of the process using chdir.
system.cwd.set = <homedir>/rtorrent

## Controls if the session torrent is saved when a torrent finishes.
## By default on.
session.on_completion.set = yes

## Controls if a lock file is created in the session directory on startup.
session.use_lock.set = yes

## Change the TOS of peer connections, by default set to throughput.
## If the option is set to default then the system default TOS is used.
## A hex value may be used for non-standard settings.
#
#tos = default|lowdelay|throughput|reliability|mincost, tos = hex

## Enable logging of the peer handshake.
## This generates a large number of log messages, but may be useful to debug connection problems.
#
#handshake_log = yes
